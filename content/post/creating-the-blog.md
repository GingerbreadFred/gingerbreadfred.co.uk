Like all programmers in the world I decided that my opinions weren't reaching the right amount of people at work so I decided to create a blog to share my wisdom with the whole world. 

This isn't my first forray into making a blog. I have had many attempts at trying to (like all programmers) create my own CMS system and frontend. They all worked to some varying degree but again like all programmers I realsed that what seemed like a trivial task at first was actually filled with all sorts of subtle and nuanced problems. Given that my main interests lie in gaming I figured something off the shelf would probably suit me better.
