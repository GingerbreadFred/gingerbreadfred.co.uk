I had a couple of free hours this morning so I went to start the headlight assembly but realised I didn't have the glue for the IVA trim. Unfortunately it's the first thing you need to do so I held off on that and installed the horns. This was quite an easy job, made slightly more complicated by the fact that I had already installed the steering rack. 

I then added some pipe lagging to the engine bay to protect the frame from the engine install and cut the IVA trim to size for the headlight assembly which I will be able to do as I now have glue! 

Samples for the wrap are being sent tomorrow and I should be able to get the headlight assemblies built!
