The day has finally arrived!

I got a call at 8:30 this morning from the delivery driver telling me that he was an hour a way. One thing that I wasn't expecting was that he asked me if we would have anyone to help as apparently unloading with 2 people is very difficult. I had a quick call around and managed to find a friend of mine who was able to duck out of work for an hour to help out (thanks Tel!) 

The driver was awesome and helped us unload really quickly. He was right having a third person was a massive help and I would highly recommend anyone reading this to have someone help you unload if possible. He also had some great advice about the front axle stand, it does not need to be that wide at all given the way the car narrows in the front so I removed one of the bars on it to avoid clipping my shins every time I walk past the front of the car. 

I was worried that the garage would not have much space but after we got the chassis off the lorry and on to the axle stands it was clear that the car would easily fit. My garage isn't the largest but there is plenty of room to manoeuvre around the car.

I have put all the parts boxes aside from the gearbox and the engine in the house for now. Fortunately my family is ok with it as it does take up a lot of space! 

I wasn't able to get any work done om the car yet as I am waiting to get the car wrapped before I build it up. I did take a quick look for the first parts of the front suspension and steering arms as those are the first thing the manual has you build. 5 boxes later I found all of the packs in the diff / z - pack box. 

I'll hopefully be able to make a start on the build over the next few days, I just need to figure out what parts I can build up without damaging the ability to wrap the car!
