## Day -2: Caterham Prep 

Delivery day is coming on Tuesday so I have been getting the final bits of garage prep done before the big day. 

I have been following a few blogs for the list of tools and consumables that I will need for the build. Given how little mechanaical work I have done in the past (change tyres / brake pads) I'm a little nervous that I both don't have the right tools, don't have enough space, and don't have the skills to build this car but that's all part of the adventure.

The main thing I did today was to setup the axle stands and add some microfiber cloths to protect the chassis from the stands when it's placed on it. The cloths are held down with cable ties as desribed [here](https://310build.com/axle-stand/)

I've also been watching as many build logs and reading as many build diaries as I can in the run up to actually building myself. The following sites have been quite useful

* [310 Build](https://310build.com)

I have someone coming to wrap the vehicle after delivery so I won't be able to start in earnest until after the wrap is done but I am hoping I can get a head start on some parts of the build before then. 

I'll be streaming the delivery and builds on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/GingerbreadRacing) and uploading the vods to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/GingerbreadRacing) so I have an archive of everything that I've done as a way to try and contribute to the community. I'll keep my eyes on the chat so if anyone has any questions I'll try and answer. 

Over a year after having put my deposit down I can't believe I'm about to get started for real!
